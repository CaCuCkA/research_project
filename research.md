# Chicago Crime Research

### Team: Ivan Varanysia, Mykola Yakovkin, Tymur Krasnianskyi

In Chicago a lot of crimes occur, so using the <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/dataset/crime.html">Dataset</a> from the local government we will analyze the criminal offenses in Chicago. We will examine the number of arrests, types of arrests, and the date when the criminal offense occurred.

>  We immediately noticed that the most common crimes are THEFT and BATTERY.

>And one more fact is that more people were not arrested than arrested after detention.

## Probability of different crimes depending on the period of the day

>Initially, we investigated different types of criminal offences depending on the time of day, our hypothesis being that all criminal offences are more likely to occur in the afternoon. Looking at the graph, it is obvious that this is true.

## The probability of arrest during the day

> We also decided to investigate the frequency of arrests during the day. And we proposed the following hypothesis: people are arrested more often from 23 to 3 am than from 19 to 23 pm. After analyzing our data, we can see that our hypothesis was not correct and still more often arrested in the evening. Therefore, we recommend the criminal society to do their bad deeds at night, less likely to be arrested.

## Probability of arrest during the year

> The next step was to examine the probability of arrest depending on the month. We thought that in any particular month there would be a significant difference, but during the year the number of arrests remains approximately the same.

## Probability of burglaries during the year

> We also decided to analyze our hypothesis that most burglaries occur in December, because of the New Year holidays, we were right. However, an interesting fact is that the summer months follow after December, this is due to vacations.

## Probability depending by the location
> The last thing we investigated was the coordinates of the crimes. We made our own map with all the locations of these crimes, which you can open in the accompanying file `ChicagoCrimes.html`, if it takes too long to open, open `ChicagoCrimes2.html`, it uses a little less data. So, as we can see, most of the crimes occurred in the city, specifically in the downtown area, less occurred in the suburbs, and two criminals somehow ended up on the border with another state.

## Conclusion
> So, we have conducted a study of crimes in the city of Chicago. We analyzed arrests and types of crimes, so we can recommend people to be more careful during the holidays and before the Christmas holidays, because then thefts often occur. We also recommend that criminals commit less thefts during the evening and more at night, so that the likelihood of arrest is significantly reduced. In general, it was very interesting for us to explore the criminal world of Chicago.
